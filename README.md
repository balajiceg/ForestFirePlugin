# Plugin for Forest Fire modelling
 Forest fire modelling using cellular automata. In this the NDVI values are used instead of specifying fuel types. The modelling is done with the consideration of the terrain, elevation, slope, humidity in the region and the wind direction. Wind direction becomes a driving factor determining the direction of spread. The inputs for the pulgin are the red and NIR bands(for computing the NDVI),Humidity,Wind direction and the seed points. All of these must be rasters, while the seed points must be of vector points.
